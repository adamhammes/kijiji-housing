        Unfortunately, kijiji has put measures in place to prevent me from
        collecting their data. As such, I can no longer update this site with
        new offers. I apologize for the inconvenience, and wish you the best of
        luck in your apartment search.
      </p>
      <p>
        Should you wish to use the data on this site for non-profit purposes,
        you can contact me at <a href="mailto:adam@hammes.io">adam@hammes.io</a>
        . I have a large amount of data collected, dating back to January of
        2018.
